      <description>First Post # Hugo uses the excellent [Go][] [html/template][gohtmltemplate] library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.</description>

      <description>Title # These documents have names that are short noun phrases. For example, &amp;ldquo;ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration&amp;rdquo;
Context: # This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.</description>

      <description>Sensible Default # We write these practices up separately because most of them are not widely used in the industry, or they are commonly misunderstood or misapplied. We believe they are a key part of the &amp;ldquo;secret sauce&amp;rdquo; that Thoughtworks brings to our clients. The practices themselves aren&amp;rsquo;t in any way secret â€” we and others talk and write about them endlessly. The secret lies in knowing which ones to use, applied in the correct context, that enable us to solve the right problems at the right time.</description>
