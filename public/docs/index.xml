      <description>Title # These documents have names that are short noun phrases. For example, &amp;ldquo;ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration&amp;rdquo;
Context: # This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.</description>

We believe they are a key part of the &amp;ldquo;secret sauce&amp;rdquo; that Thoughtworks brings to our clients. The practices themselves aren&amp;rsquo;t in any way secret â€” we and others talk and write about them endlessly. The secret lies in knowing which ones to use, applied in the correct context, that enable us to solve the right problems at the right time.</description>
