# Title

These documents have names that are short noun phrases. For example, "ADR 1: Deployment on Ruby on Rails 3.0.10" or "ADR 9: LDAP for Multitenant Integration"

## Context:
This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.

## Decision:
This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with an active voice. "We will â€¦"

## Status:
A decision may be "proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed with it yet, or "accepted" once it is agreed. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

## Consequences:
This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative(tech-debt), and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.


### Comments
The principles will help you to understand and use the template:

Light : Agile methods are not opposed to documentation, only to valueless documentation. Keeping ADR simple and light will help us easy to read and understand, with reasonable maintenance effort.
Consistent : Documentation is not the end, but the beginning, with ADR, we can easily share the motivation behind the decision, increase visibility for everyone, present for the future, and learn from the evolving.
...

Scenarios that ADR may help:
Cross team discussion and collaboration
Architecture changes (more about arch)
New service created
Important tools/frameworks changes


Scenarios that ADR may not suggest:
Too details about the discussion, with less or no impact of architectural
...
