We write these practices up separately because most of them are not widely used in the industry, or they are commonly misunderstood or misapplied. We believe they are a key part of the "secret sauce" that Thoughtworks brings to our clients. The practices themselves aren't in any way secret â€” we and others talk and write about them endlessly. The secret lies in knowing which ones to use, applied in the correct context, that enable us to solve the right problems at the right time.
